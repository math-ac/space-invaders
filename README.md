# Space Invaders

## Prerequisites

To run the program is necessary the P3 assembler as well the simulator. They can
be found [here](http://algos.inesc-id.pt/arq-comp/?Material_Did%C3%A1tico___Processador_P3).

Make sure that the assembler version corresponds to the system.

Since the simulator itself is written in Java, make sure that java is also installed on the system.

## Compiling

To compile and run the program use:

```
$ make
```
As a side note, the assembler in the Makefile may need to be changed depending on the system.
